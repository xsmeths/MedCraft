Zombie_Striker -> Hugely improved the codebase with config parsing and custom item handler, also
many improvements that I'd probably have never done without them, thank you, you're epic!

MrRhetorical -> Has helped me lots over the last few years and continues to help me whenever I get stuck, thanks bro :)

Chasef8 -> Came up with the original idea for Bandages which turned into BandageCraft and was eventually adapted into what is now MedCraft

Everyone who uses or has used this plugin and/or gives ideas for its continued development

love you all
